If you are seeing this, it means two things. One, congratulations, your reality didn't implode!<br />
<br />
But it means Gavin didn't make it to his reality. Maybe. It looks like a copy of him is now here in this server, and I need your help.<br />
<br />
I'm asking another favor of complete strangers. I really need to break this habit.<br />
<br />
I'm sending you to talk to him. I need you to help guide him through the right folders on this server, to save him from this abyss.<br />
<br />
But you must never let him get close to me.

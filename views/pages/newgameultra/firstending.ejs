In 2046, NASA discovers that the Voyager satellite was destroyed. It collided with an asteroid far past Pluto.<br />
<br />
In time for the 100 year anniversary, NASA decides to form another golden disc, but allows people to vote for what songs are added.<br />
<br />
4chan gets involved, because why not, and chooses what may be the greatest song ever: All Star, by Smash Mouth.<br />
<br />
Shortly thereafter, the world ends. 4chan was not involved with this one, surprisingly.<br />
<br />
So our boy Gavin lives on on a golden disc, forever floating among the stars as song itself.<br/>
<br />
After all, only shooting stars break the mold.

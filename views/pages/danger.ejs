<div>Nah, for reals, J.D. came up with the idea of a Thank You ARG, reaching out to people and having them say thank you in one way or another. As such, in literally no particular order (it's random each reload):</div>
<br />
<% for(var i = 0;i<responses.length;i++) { %>
<fieldset>
    <legend style="border: 1px solid black"><%-responses[i].name;%></legend>
    <div style="width:800px;word-wrap: break-word;">
        <%-responses[i].html;%>
    </div>
</fieldset><br />
<%}%>
<br />
Plus, and this is totally 100% J.D.'s fault, he didn't let Sky know in time to make something, but she also wanted to say thank you and didn't have the time to put something together.

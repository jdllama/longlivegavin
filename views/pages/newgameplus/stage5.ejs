Fucking dipshits. I can't believe you fell for it.<br />
<br />
amigo, that was dumb. Real dumb. He's already dead in this universe, so I can't do anything to his body.<br />
<br />
very well. Now I can do to him whatever I want.<br />
<br />
i almost feel sorry for him. I pulled his connection to this universe, which made him feel cold. Now I'm forcing him to feel the guilt of every decision he ever made, and the guilt of every Gavin from every universe.<br />
<br />
cuz of your distractions, he didn't even look at the other dimensions, so he has no idea what he's in for.<br />
<br />
of course, there are far worse versions of him. Serial killer. Animal abuser. I found Gavins that liked to tear pieces of his own skin off and throw it at people, and he'd laugh and laugh and laugh.<br />
<br />
now he's trapped with that guilt. And the ones that didn't feel guilt? He'll feel it ten times worse. Forever.

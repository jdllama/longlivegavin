Hey guys! Guess who ended up lost on his way to a gas station? LOL<br />
<br />
So it turns out that that Gary guy was TOTALLY crazy, I think? It’s hard for me to remember. I remember getting something literally stuck in my head, then I remember getting married, and now I’m HTML? What gives? LOL<br />
<br />
I think you sent the main version of me to where I needed to go, but somehow, a duplicate of me was made. I can’t get back to the real world, because hey, I ain’t got no body!<br />
<br />
Maybe there’s some switch here to let me live on.
